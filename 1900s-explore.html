        <h2>Ford Model T: The Game Changer</h2>
        <p>
            Introduced in 1908, the Ford Model T revolutionized transportation. It was affordable, reliable, and built on the first moving assembly line — making it accessible to the middle class.

    <h3>Economy and Work Culture</h3>
        <br />
    <p>
        In 1903, Henry Ford founded Ford Motor Company and began reshaping the economy. His groundbreaking decision to pay workers $5 a day in 1914 was more than generosity — it gave his own employees the purchasing power to buy the cars they built, which drastically reduced employee turnover.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ford also pioneered vertical integration: he owned rubber plantations, steel mills, and even railroads — controlling everything from raw materials to final production.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Roads and Urbanization</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            In the early 1900s, America’s roads were mainly muddy trails, suited more for horses than cars. Most were impassable after rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Car owners, farmers, and bicycle clubs advocated for better roads. This led to the <strong>Federal Aid Road Act of 1916</strong>, marking the beginning of the U.S. federal government's involvement in road building.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interestingly, the push for “Good Roads” initially came from bicyclists, not motorists.

        <h3>Impact on American Families</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            The automobile became more than just a machine — it was a gateway to freedom. For many rural families, cars reduced isolation and improved access to healthcare, education, and social life.
        </p>
        <p>
            For families who couldn’t afford a car, they became aspirational symbols — signs of independence, self-reliance, and modernity.

            <h3>Environmental Effects</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
                Ironically, early cars were considered environmentally friendly compared to horse-drawn transport. In cities, horses left behind manure and often died in the street.
            </p>
            <p>
                But cars brought new issues: air pollution, oil dependency, and sprawling development. In 1900, few imagined the long-term environmental consequences of the internal combustion engine.
