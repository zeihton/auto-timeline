        <h1>The Automobile in the Age of War (1914–1945)</h1>
        <p>When cars became weapons — and women, workers.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>World War I (1914–1918)</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>During WWI, automobiles were used for the first time on a massive scale in warzones: ambulances, troop transport, and even armored cars replaced horse-drawn wagons.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/ww1-armored-car.jpg" alt="WWI Armored Car" />

        <p><strong>Early Mass Mobilization:</strong> The U.S. Army purchased over 12,000 trucks and cars during WWI, helping to shift perceptions of cars as utility machines, not just luxuries.</p>

        <p><strong>Technical innovation under pressure:</strong> Military need accelerated advancements in engines, durability, and off-road performance.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>World War II (1939–1945)</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>In WWII, the auto industry *became* the war machine. Civilian car production stopped entirely. Factories switched to building tanks, bombers, and jeeps.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Economy</h3>
        <p>Ford’s Willow Run plant produced one B-24 bomber every hour by 1944. GM built over 850,000 military trucks. Civilian car manufacturing was banned from 1942 to 1945.</p>

        <h3>Roads & Urbanization</h3>
        <p>New roads and highways were built with military logistics in mind — shaping postwar transportation forever. Detroit earned the nickname <em>“The Arsenal of Democracy.”</em></p>

        <h3>American Families</h3>
        <p>Rosie the Riveter represented the 350,000+ women who worked in auto plants. For the first time, women assembled engines and armored vehicles.</p>

        <p>Families learned to keep and maintain old cars, sharing rides, and adapting — a preview of postwar consumer pragmatism.</p>

        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>Wartime production polluted heavily, but the drastic drop in civilian driving improved air quality in many industrial cities — an unexpected positive side effect.</p>

        <h2>📜 Restranscription of a dialogue with a former automotive technician</h2>
        <div class="transcription-box">
            <p><em>
   <strong>Me:</strong>Can you tell me about American vehicles used during World War I?<br />

   <strong>Christophe:</strong> Yes. The U.S. entered the war in 1917, and the car industry quickly shifted to military production. Companies like Ford, Packard, and Dodge were key players.<br />

   <strong>Me:</strong> What kind of vehicles were made?<br />

    <strong>Christophe:</strong> Mostly trucks, ambulances, and transport cars. The Ford Model T was adapted into an ambulance and a light transport vehicle. It was cheap, simple, easy to repair.<br />

    <strong>Me:</strong> Any special models?<br />

    <strong>Christophe:</strong> The Liberty Truck. It was a standard military truck, developed by the U.S. Army with input from different manufacturers. Around 9,000 were built during the war.<br />

    <strong>Me:</strong> Did you ever see these vehicles?<br />

    <strong>Christophe:</strong> I saw a restored Liberty Truck at the Gazoline Festival in Lamotte-Beuvron in 2019. Beautiful restoration. The owner told me it had been found in a barn in Ohio. <br />

    <strong>Me:</strong> Were these vehicles used only in Europe?<br />

    <strong>Christophe:</strong> Mostly, yes. They were shipped overseas to support the American Expeditionary Forces. Some stayed in Europe after the war. Others came back or were sold as surplus.<br />

    <strong>Me:</strong> What happened to the car industry after the war?<br />

    <strong>Christophe:</strong> Many factories returned to civilian production. But the war changed everything—mass production was faster, logistics better. The war helped shape the modern American auto industry.
