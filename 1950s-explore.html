        <h2>Design Takes the Wheel</h2>
        <p>
            After World War II, the U.S. economy boomed, and the auto industry exploded with creativity. Cars were longer, lower, and flashier. Chrome trims, tailfins, and bold colors defined the era.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manufacturers like Cadillac, Chevrolet, and Chrysler competed to create the most stylish and powerful vehicles — making cars a symbol of prosperity and identity.

        <h3>Suburbs and the American Dream</h3>
        <p>
            The GI Bill and postwar housing boom encouraged millions of Americans to move to the suburbs. These sprawling neighborhoods were only accessible by car.
        </p>
        <p>
            A vehicle became a necessity for commuting, shopping, and leisure — integrating the automobile into daily life like never before.

        <h3>Drive-In Culture</h3>
        <p>
            Cars weren’t just for transport — they became part of leisure. Drive-in movies and restaurants emerged across the country, offering a unique fusion of entertainment and mobility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teens cruised the streets, dated at drive-ins, and customized their cars. The automobile had officially become part of youth culture.

        <h3>Highway Expansion Begins</h3>
        <p>
            With cars central to American life, the need for better infrastructure became clear. In 1956, President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act, launching the construction of the Interstate Highway System.
        </p>

            It transformed travel across the country and laid the foundation for modern logistics and suburban expansion.

            <h3>Environmental Footprint Begins</h3>
            <p>
                No one talked about emissions yet, but the environmental cost was beginning to build. Air pollution in cities worsened as more cars filled the roads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gas was cheap, and engines were big — performance mattered more than efficiency in this era.
