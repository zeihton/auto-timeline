        <h2>Economy and the Oil Crisis</h2>
        <p>
            The 1970s hit the U.S. economy hard. Two major oil crises — in 1973 and 1979 — caused gasoline prices to triple and disrupted everyday life. Americans were forced to rethink their relationship with the automobile.

        <p>
            Detroit’s automakers, still building large sedans and luxury vehicles, struggled to adapt. Meanwhile, Japanese brands like Toyota and Honda gained ground with affordable, compact, fuel-efficient cars.

        <h2>Roads and Urbanization</h2>
        <p>
            Fuel shortages led to long lines at gas stations and government-imposed rationing. Carpooling became popular, and for the first time, drivers began to worry about how far their car could take them — introducing the idea of “range anxiety.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The freedom once associated with driving began to feel restricted. Gasoline was no longer guaranteed, and families had to plan carefully.

        <h2>Impact on American Families</h2>
        <p>
            Large family cars fell out of favor. Many households traded their big V8-powered sedans for smaller, more economical models — including imports.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, public trust in American car brands began to erode. Mechanical issues, poor fuel economy, and recalls contributed to the perception that “Made in Japan” meant quality, while “Made in Detroit” meant trouble.

        <h2>Environmental Awareness</h2>
        <p>
            The 1970s marked a turning point in environmental policy. The <strong>Clean Air Act</strong> passed in 1970, leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
        </p>

            In 1975, the <strong>catalytic converter</strong> became mandatory for most new cars — a key invention that helped reduce toxic emissions like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides.
